1. Given the values table below, what data types do each of these values represent?

    A Clockwork Orange is a string.
    42 is an integer.
    09/02/1945 is a date.
    98.7 is a float.
    15.99 is a float.

2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

    You would use a database anytime you want persistent data for an application that multiple people will be using.
    You might use a text file if you were the only person who would be using the application, but even then I would say
    a database is usually a better choice.  I personally would only use a text file for something like this assignment.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

    SQL is declarative rather than procedural, which means you don't have to give it the steps to get the answer.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

    I'm not sure I understand the question - a database is a system that will store data in an organized manner
    and allow you to retrieve it via queries.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

    The table would be the entire spreadsheet - each table will have it's own columns and rows.
    A row would contain each entry into the database that corresponds to the column.
    A column would be what each value below represents (name, address, email, etc).
    A value would be an entry in database, or in spreadsheet terms, a single cell.

6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

    String, Integer, Float.

7. Given the payments table below, provide an English description and the results for the following queries:

    SELECT amount
    FROM payments
    WHERE amount > 500;

        What amounts on payment table are greater than $500
        Result:
            1500.00

    SELECT *
    FROM payments
    WHERE payee = "Mega Foods";

        What data is available on payment table for "Mega Foods" as payee?
        Result:
            6/15/16         Mega Foods      124.93      Groceries
