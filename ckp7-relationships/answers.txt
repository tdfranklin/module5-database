1. Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data).
    Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:

                SEE hotel.sql FOR SQL FILE

        Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.

                SELECT guests.first_name, guests.last_name
                FROM bookings
                FULL JOIN guests ON bookings.guest = guests.id
                WHERE bookings.room IS NULL;

        Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.

                SELECT guests.first_name, guests.last_name, bookings.check_in
                FROM bookings
                FULL JOIN guests ON bookings.guest = guests.id
                GROUP BY check_in, first_name, last_name
                HAVING count (check_in) > 1;

        Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.

                SELECT first_name, last_name
                FROM bookings
                FULL JOIN guests ON guest = id
                GROUP BY first_name, last_name
                HAVING count(first_name) > 1;

        Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.

                SELECT DISTINCT count(guest), room
                FROM bookings
                GROUP BY room;

2. Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.

        Work through the questions from the example above.

                What classes/entites do we need to model?

                        Classes, Students, Grades

                What fields/attributes will each entity need?

                        Classes - ID, Subject, Room_Number
                        Students - ID, Name, Email
                        Grades - Student, Class, Grade

                What data types do we need to use?

                        Pretty much just integer and varchar.

                What relationships exist between entities?

                        Many to many: students will have many classes and classes will have many students.  We will use Grades as a join table to link the two.

                How should those relationships be represented in tables?

                        grades.student = students.id and grades.class = classes.id

        Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data types should be used, etc., and include them in a text file.
        Ask questions of your mentor if you are unsure about parts of your model.
        Draw the model using the notation used in the checkpoint and submit a picture. You can also use a tool like StarUML or quickdatabasediagrams.com if you choose.

3. Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data).
    Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:

        Find all students who have taken a particular class.

                SELECT name, subject, grade
                FROM grades
                JOIN students ON grades.student = students.id
                JOIN classes ON grades.class = classes.id
                WHERE subject = 'subject_name';

        Count the number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.

                SELECT grade, count(grade)
                FROM grades
                WHERE class = class_number
                GROUP BY grade;

        Find class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.

                SELECT subject, count(subject)
                FROM grades
                JOIN classes ON grades.class = classes.id
                GROUP BY subject;

        Find the class taken by the largest number of students.

                SELECT subject
                FROM grades
                JOIN classes ON grades.class = classes.id
                GROUP BY subject
                ORDER BY count(subject) DESC LIMIT 1;
